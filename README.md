## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### API & Authentication
1. **"YouTube API key is required"**: Make sure you've entered a valid API key in the block settings
2. **"YouTube API error: Invalid credentials"**: Check that your API key is correct and has YouTube Data API v3 enabled
3. **API quota exceeded**: YouTube API has daily quotas; consider reducing update frequency or enable caching

#### URL & Channel Issues
4. **"Could not find the YouTube channel"**: 
   - Verify the channel URL is correct and the channel exists
   - Try using a direct channel URL (`youtube.com/channel/UC...`) if @handle doesn't work
   - Check if the channel is public (private channels won't work)

5. **"Invalid channel URL"**: Ensure your URL matches one of the supported formats (see Supported URL Formats section)

6. **"Channel not found or has no uploads"**: 
   - The channel might be empty, private, or have no public videos
   - Verify the channel has uploaded videos that are publicly available

#### Display & Layout Issues
7. **Videos not displaying in grid**: Check if you've selected the correct layout in block settings
8. **Carousel not working**: Ensure you've selected "Carousel" layout and the page has loaded completely
9. **Media player thumbnails not clickable**: This is normal in the editor; functionality works on the frontend

#### Performance Issues
10. **Slow loading**: Enable caching and consider reducing the number of videos displayed
11. **Too many API calls**: Use auto-update with daily or weekly frequency instead of hourly

### Debug Information

- Check your WordPress error logs for detailed error messages from the YouTube API
- Use browser developer tools to check for JavaScript errors
- Test with a simple channel URL first (like `@WordPress`) before trying complex URLs
- Verify your API key works by testing it directly in Google's API Explorer

### Getting Help

When reporting issues, please provide:
- WordPress version and PHP version
- The exact YouTube URL you're trying to use
- Any error messages from the browser console or WordPress logs
